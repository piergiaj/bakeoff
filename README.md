ReciCopy is a social recipe site.

In a real recipe sharing environment, like with your mom and your grandma, your grandma doesn't just give your mom a recipe, your mom loves it, and that's the only way she ever makes it. In reality, your mom get's the recipe, doesn't like some ingredients, changes the recipe a bit, and tells your grandma that her version turned out even better!

This is the idea behind ReciCopy. Anyone can visit the site to see recipes and cook what's there. But the real power comes when you register to become a Chef, and ReciCopy someone else's Recipe. Everyone can see ReciCopies of recipes and see what different Chefs have done to make each recipe their own. You can trace back to where a Recipe originated from, and search an entire ReciCopy tree to find the recipe that fits exactly what your taste buds desire.

Feel free to register to be a Chef, post some of your original recipes, and start ReciCopying today!
